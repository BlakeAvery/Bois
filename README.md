# Bois: Vague airline reservation system

An airline reservation system. Idea taken from that one github repo with all the beginning 
program designs.

**What does this do?**

The program should generate a list of flights. You can then do 4
things: Search for a flight, book a number of seats on a flight,
print out the list of flights, or add a new flight to the list.

**What needs to be fixed?**

The project needs some major code refactoring, MAJOR REFACTORING. I'll get to that
eventually.

**License**

the license later. The latest version of the program is always on Github, 
along with the latest license. If you're unsure of the license the 
program is under, check the [BlakeAvery/Bois](https://github.com/BlakeAvery/Bois) repo.
